# Tweak AI

Tweaks AI to make enemies feel lively instead of pondering rocks. Also fixes worm "bug".

General Changes

- Enemies spawn in "Combat" state
- Makes "Wander" state more wander-y by going to a player's last known position or a random map node

Magma/Overloading Worm

- Prevents worms from randomly targeting something far away
