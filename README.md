# Tweak AI

Makes default AI state "Wander" and makes this state better by adding target locations instead of a random nearby node (original functionality). The state will try for a random player location, then a random player spawn point, then a random map node if the others fail.

Note: This is not an AI rewrite or anything, the AI is still funky this mod just makes initial spawns likelier to spot you and go into their "Combat" state.
